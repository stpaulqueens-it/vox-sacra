## Reading I – Genesis 3:8–15

*The Fall and the First Promise of Redemption*

When they heard the sound of the LORD God walking about in the garden at the breezy time of the day, the man and his wife hid themselves from the LORD God among the trees of the garden.

The LORD God then called to the man and asked him: "Where are you?"

He answered, "I heard you in the garden; but I was afraid, because I was naked, so I hid."

Then God asked: "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I had forbidden you to eat?"

The man replied, "The woman whom you put here with me—she gave me fruit from the tree, so I ate it."

The LORD God then asked the woman: "What is this you have done?" The woman answered, "The snake tricked me, so I ate it."

Then the LORD God said to the snake:

"Because you have done this, cursed are you among all the animals, tame or wild; on your belly you shall crawl, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.

I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; they will strike at your head, while you strike at their heel."

Dispel the long night's ling'ring gloom, and pierce the shadows of the tomb.

From that high mountain clothed with awe gavest thy folk the elder law.

## Reading II – Genesis 22:15–18

*God's Promise to Abraham*

A second time the angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven and said:

"I swear by my very self—oracle of the LORD—that because you acted as you did in not withholding from me your son, your only one, I will bless you and make your descendants as countless as the stars of the sky and the sands of the seashore; your descendants will take possession of the gates of their enemies, and in your descendants all the nations of the earth will find blessing, because you obeyed my command."

## Creator of the Stars of Night

*Latin hymn (9th Century)*

This ancient evening hymn is sung as a response to the second reading.

## Reading III – Isaiah 9:1–6

*The People Who Walked in Darkness Have Seen a Great Light*

The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; upon those who lived in a land of gloom a light has shone.

You have brought them abundant joy and great rejoicing; they rejoice before you as people rejoice at harvest, as they exult when dividing the spoils.

For the yoke that burdened them, the pole on their shoulder, the rod of their taskmaster, you have smashed, as on the day of Midian.

For every boot that tramped in battle, every cloak rolled in blood, will be burned as fuel for fire.

For a child is born to us, a son is given to us; upon his shoulder dominion rests. They name him Wonder-Counselor, God-Hero, Father-Forever, Prince of Peace.

His dominion is vast and forever peaceful, upon David's throne, and over his kingdom, which he confirms and sustains by judgment and justice, both now and forever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this!

## Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming

*14th Century German melody*

### Verse 1

Lo, how a Rose e'er blooming from tender stem hath sprung!  
Of Jesse's lineage coming, as men of old have sung.  
It came, a flow'ret bright, amid the cold of winter, when half-spent was the night.

### Verse 2

Isaiah 'twas foretold it, the Rose I have in mind;  
With Mary we behold it, the Virgin Mother kind.  
To show God's love aright, she bore to men a Savior, when half-spent was the night.

---

## Reading IV – Isaiah 11:1–9

*The Peaceable Kingdom*

But a shoot shall sprout from the stump of Jesse, and from his roots a bud shall blossom.

The spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him: a spirit of wisdom and of understanding, a spirit of counsel and of strength, a spirit of knowledge and of fear of the LORD, and his delight shall be the fear of the LORD.

Not by appearance shall he judge, nor by hearsay shall he decide, but he shall judge the poor with justice, and decide fairly for the land's afflicted. He shall strike the ruthless with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked.

Justice shall be the band around his waist, and faithfulness a belt upon his hips.

Then the wolf shall be a guest of the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat; the calf and the young lion shall browse together, with a little child to guide them.

The cow and the bear shall graze, together their young shall lie down; the lion shall eat hay like the ox.

The baby shall play by the viper's den, and the child lay his hand on the adder's lair.

They shall not harm or destroy on all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be filled with knowledge of the LORD, as water covers the sea.

## Once in Royal David's City

*H.J. Gauntlett, arr. David Willcocks*

### Verse 1

Once in royal David's city stood a lowly cattle shed, where a mother laid her baby in a manger for his bed:  
Mary was that mother mild, Jesus Christ, her little child.

### Verse 2

He came down to earth from heaven, who is God and Lord of all, and his shelter was a stable, and his cradle was a stall; with the poor, and mean, and lowly, lived on earth our Savior holy.

### Verse 3

And through all his wondrous childhood he would honor and obey, love, and watch the lowly maiden, in whose gentle arms he lay:  
Christian children all must be mild, obedient, good as he.

### Verse 4

For he is our childhood's pattern, day by day like us he grew, he was little, weak, and helpless, tears and smiles like us he knew; and he feeleth for our sadness, and he shareth in our gladness.

### Verse 6

Not in that poor lowly stable, with the oxen standing by, we shall see him; but in heaven, set at God's right hand on high; when like stars his children crowned all in white shall wait around.

## Reading V – Luke 1:26–38

*The Annunciation*

In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary.

And coming to her, he said, "Hail, favored one! The Lord is with you."

But she was greatly troubled at what was said and pondered what sort of greeting this might be.

Then the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus.

He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end."

But Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, since I have no relations with a man?"

And the angel said to her in reply, "The holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.

And behold, Elizabeth, your relative, has also conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren; for nothing will be impossible for God."

Mary said, "Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word." Then the angel departed from her.

## Ave Maria

*Jacques Arcadelt, 16th Century*

Ave Maria, gratia plena,  
Dominus tecum;  
benedicta tu in mulieribus,  
et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus.  
Sancta Maria, Mater Dei,  
ora pro nobis peccatoribus,  
nunc et in hora mortis nostrae.  
Amen.

## Reading VI – Matthew 1:18–25

*The Birth of Jesus Christ*

Now this is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about. When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found with child through the holy Spirit.

Joseph her husband, since he was a righteous man, yet unwilling to expose her to shame, decided to divorce her quietly.

Such was his intention when, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife into your home. For it is through the holy Spirit that this child has been conceived in her.

She will bear a son and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."

All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: "Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel," which means "God is with us."

When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took his wife into his home. He had no relations with her until she bore a son, and he named him Jesus.

## Silent Night

*Franz Gruber, arr. John Rutter*

### Verse 1

Silent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright, round yon Virgin, Mother and Child, holy Infant so tender and mild, sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace.

### Verse 2

Silent night, holy night, shepherds quake at the sight; glories stream from heaven afar, heav'nly hosts sing: "Alleluia! Christ the Savior is born! Christ the Savior is born!"

### Verse 3

Silent night, holy night, Son of God, love's pure light, radiant beams from thy holy face, with the dawn of redeeming grace, Jesus, Lord, at thy birth, Jesus, Lord, at thy birth.

## Reading VII – Luke 2:8–20

*The Birth of Jesus Announced to Shepherds*

Now there were shepherds in that region living in the fields and keeping the night watch over their flock.

The angel of the Lord appeared to them and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were struck with great fear.

The angel said to them, "Do not be afraid; for behold, I proclaim to you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.

For today in the city of David a savior has been born for you who is Messiah and Lord.

And this will be a sign for you: you will find an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger."

And suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host with the angel, praising God and saying: "Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests."

When the angels went away from them to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let us go, then, to Bethlehem to see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us."

So they went in haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger.

When they saw this, they made known the message that had been told them about this child.

All who heard it were amazed by what had been told them by the shepherds.

And Mary kept all these things, reflecting on them in her heart.

Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, just as it had been told to them.

## Hark! The Herald Angels Sing

*Felix Mendelssohn, arr. David Willcocks*

### Verse 1

Hark! the herald angels sing, "Glory to the newborn King; peace on earth, and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled." Joyful, all ye nations, rise, join the triumph of the skies; with the angelic host proclaim, "Christ is born in Bethlehem!" Hark! the herald angels sing, "Glory to the newborn King!"

### Verse 2

Christ, by highest heav'n adored, Christ, the everlasting Lord, late in time behold him come, offspring of a Virgin's womb. Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see; hail th'incarnate Deity, pleased, as man, with men to dwell, Jesus, our Emmanuel. Hark! the herald angels sing, "Glory to the newborn King!"

### Verse 3

Hail! the heav'n-born Prince of Peace! Hail! the Son of Righteousness! Light and life to all he brings, ris'n with healing in his wings. Mild he lays his glory by, born that man no more may die, born to raise the sons of earth, born to give them second birth. Hark! the herald angels sing, "Glory to the newborn King!"

## Reading VIII – Matthew 2:1–12

*The Visit of the Magi*

When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod, behold, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying, "Where is the newborn king of the Jews? We saw his star at its rising and have come to do him homage."

When King Herod heard this, he was greatly troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

Assembling all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born.

They said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it has been written through the prophet: 'And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; since from you shall come a ruler, who is to shepherd my people Israel.'"

Then Herod called the magi secretly and ascertained from them the time of the star's appearance.

He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search diligently for the child. When you have found him, bring me word, that I too may go and do him homage."

After their audience with the king they set out. And behold, the star that they had seen at its rising preceded them, until it came and stopped over the place where the child was.

They were overjoyed at seeing the star, and on entering the house they saw the child with Mary his mother. They prostrated themselves and did him homage.

Then they opened their treasures and offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed for their country by another way.

## In Dulci Jubilo

*Old German carol, arr. R. L. Pearsall*

### Verse 1

In dulci jubilo, let us our homage show: our heart's joy reclineth in praesepio; and like a bright star shineth matris in gremio, Alpha es et O!

### Verse 2

O Jesu, parvule, I yearn for thee alway! Hear me, I beseech thee, O puer optime; my prayer, let it reach thee, O princeps gloriae! Trahe me post te!

### Verse 3

O patris caritas! O nati lenitas! Deeply were we stained per nostra crimina; but thou hast for us gained coelorum gaudia. — O that we were there! — O that we were there!

### Verse 4

Ubi sunt gaudia, where, if they be not there? There are angels singing nova cantica; there the bells are ringing, in Regis curia. — O that we were there! — O that we were there!

## Reading IX – John 1:1–14

*The Word Became Flesh*

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

He was in the beginning with God.

All things came to be through him, and without him nothing came to be. What came to be through him was life, and this life was the light of the human race; the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

A man named John was sent from God. He came for testimony, to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but came to testify to the light.

The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.

He was in the world, and the world came to be through him, but the world did not know him.

He came to what was his own, but his own people did not accept him.

But to those who did accept him he gave power to become children of God, to those who believe in his name, who were born not by natural generation nor by human choice nor by a man's decision but of God.

And the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us, and we saw his glory, the glory as of the Father's only Son, full of grace and truth.

## O Come, All Ye Faithful

**Refrain:** O come, let us adore him, O come, let us adore him, O come, let us adore him, Christ the Lord.

### Verse 2

God of God, Light of Light, lo! he abhors not the Virgin's womb; very God, begotten, not created.

### Verse 6

Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation, sing, all ye citizens of heaven above! Glory to God in the highest.

### Verse 7

Yea, Lord, we greet thee, born this happy morning, Jesu, to thee be glory given; Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing!

#### Verse 5

Then entered in those wise men three, full reverently upon their knee, and offered there in his presence their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
